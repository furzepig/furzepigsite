        <h1>The Mower</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        The mower stalled, twice; kneeling, I found</br>  
        A hedgehog jammed up against the blades,</br> 
        Killed. It had been in the long grass.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I had seen it before, and even fed it, once.</br>   
        Now I had mauled its unobtrusive world</br>
        Unmendably. Burial was no help:</br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Next morning I got up and it did not.</br>
        The first day after a death, the new absence</br>  
        Is always the same; we should be careful</br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Of each other, we should be kind</br>
        While there is still time.</br>
        </p>
